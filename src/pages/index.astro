      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Design a vibrant, interactive website called 'Urban Secrets Revealed'. The platform's core function is to allow users to discover and share unique, lesser-known places within cities. The target audience is urban explorers, locals seeking new experiences, and tourists looking for authentic adventures. The site must include a map-based interface where users can submit locations, add photos, write reviews, and rate the hidden gems. Implement a search function with filters for categories like 'restaurants', 'art', 'nature', 'history', etc. Consider incorporating a system for users to create and share their own curated 'secret' itineraries. The aesthetic should be modern, playful, and visually appealing, with an emphasis on user-generated content and community interaction. Prioritize mobile responsiveness.</p>
